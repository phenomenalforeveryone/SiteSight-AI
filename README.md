# SiteSight AI 🚧👷‍♂️

## AI-Driven Virtual Safety Inspection & Risk Intelligence System

### 🔍 Overview
SiteSight AI is an AI-powered software system designed to improve safety monitoring on construction sites.  
It acts as a **virtual safety inspector**, continuously analyzing camera feeds to detect unsafe situations, PPE violations, and high-risk zones — without identifying or tracking individuals.

### 🎯 Problem
Construction sites are dynamic and hazardous environments where:
- Manual safety inspections are time-limited
- Human monitoring cannot be continuous
- Risks are often detected only after incidents occur

### 💡 Solution
SiteSight AI provides:
- Continuous visual safety monitoring using cameras
- Detection of unsafe situations (e.g., missing helmets, restricted zone entry)
- Risk-based alerts and summaries for site managers
- Ethical AI design (no face recognition, no worker tracking)

### 🧠 Current Prototype
This repository currently contains:
- A basic vision module prototype (image loading and execution verified)
- Project folder structure for scalable development
